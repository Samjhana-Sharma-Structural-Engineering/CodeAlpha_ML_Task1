**Welcome to the Repository !!!**

In this repository, you will find the source code for machine learning projects Task1 Disease Prediction from Medical data completed during my CodeAlpha internship.

Below is an overview of each project:

**Projects Overview**

1.	**Disease Prediction from Medical Data:** In this project, a machine learning model was developed to predict heart disease based on medical data. By utilizing various health metrics, the model assists in early diagnosis and provides recommendations for effective healthcare solutions.
   
o **codealpha_disease_prediction_from_medical_data.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


o **heart.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.
